A user receives email with link to the event - upstreamproductions.ca/event/201
Player JS client starts in users web browser

Proposal
   Use REACT for the player 
      Play video, chat, questions
      Only connection is to the MQTT broker
      Non-HTML clients are easier to create
   Use Drupal front end for everything else
      Event creation and management
      Event Registration
      Reports
      Upstream productions primary website
    
Why REACT 
  Decouples the video player page from Drupal.
    Therefore we can create a native easier - apple ios, droid
  All communications through the MQTT broker
    MQTT is extremely light
    Each production will have its own production client
       They can maintain state - list of chats, questions
       The production client bootstraps Drupal
       

Why not REACT?
   Why use Drupal frontend
      Webform and all it's functionality.
